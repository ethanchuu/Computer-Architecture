Programming Assignment I (PA1): C Programming Basics
PA1 involves six small programs to get hands-on experience with programming in C. These include
string manipulations, sorting, stack-based balancing checks, linked list operations, matrix
exponentiation, and binary search tree manipulations. Notable programs include:
- rot13: A string cipher encoder/decoder.
- sorta: Lexicographical string sorter.
- balance: Checks for balanced parentheses, brackets, and braces in strings.
- list: Implements and maintains a sorted linked list.
- mexp: Multiplies a square matrix by itself a specified number of times.
- bst: Binary Search Tree operations including insertion, deletion, and traversal.

Programming Assignment II (PA2): Machine Learning in C
PA2 introduces machine learning concepts by implementing a one-shot learning algorithm to predict
house prices based on historical data. The program calculates weights for house attributes using
matrix operations like transposing, multiplying, and inverting matrices. Key highlights include:
- Using the Gauss-Jordan elimination method for matrix inversion.
- Computing weights using the pseudo-inverse formula: W = (X^T X)^(-1) X^T Y.
- Predicting house prices for new input data based on computed weights.

Programming Assignment III (Bomb Lab): Debugging Binary Bombs
The Bomb Lab tasks students with defusing a 'binary bomb' by analyzing its assembly code and
identifying the correct input strings for each phase. It emphasizes using debugging tools like gdb to:
- Trace program execution line-by-line.
- Set breakpoints and inspect registers and memory.
- Disassemble the binary to understand its logic.
The bomb contains multiple phases, each requiring critical thinking and debugging expertise to
avoid explosions.

Programming Assignment IV (PA4): Digital Logic and Truth Tables
PA4 focuses on digital logic design by implementing a program to generate truth tables from circuit
descriptions. Students work with a custom specification language to define circuits using logic gates
(AND, OR, NOT, etc.) and other components (e.g., multiplexers, decoders). Key elements include:
- Parsing circuit descriptions into a data structure.
- Efficiently generating and printing truth table rows on-the-fly.
- Handling large truth tables with millions of rows by leveraging optimized algorithms and data
structures.
